# Whatever...

A collection of ... stuff. Mostly very small programs.

## Getting Started

Each project does something different. Very few are worth your time.

## Building

Each project needs to be built differently, if it needs to be built. There is no provided function to build every project.

## Contributing

if ya want to, then sure, maybe. But the point of these small projects means there's no need.

## License

Each project is licensed differently.

No idiots clause: No project in this repository has a warranty, regardless of how it is licensed.
