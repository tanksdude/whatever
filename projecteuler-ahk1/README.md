# Project Euler Problem 1 in AutoHotkey

Project Euler problem #1 done in AHK. That's it.

## Why?

Project Euler lets you set the programming language you use to solve the problems. It doesn't mean much but it is possible to be viewed. You got Python and Java and C/C++ and your other stuffs (maybe even HTML, I haven't checked in a long time), but there's also Scratch and AHK. I would rather not touch Scratch, so I want to do a math problem in AHK. What could go horribly wrong?

### does it work?

yeah

### ... well?

No. It's AHK. A scripting language designed for making your own hotkeys/macros. (Though it does produce the correct answer pretty quickly.)

But the first few problems are pretty simple math problems so they should all be "easily" solved in AHK. The later problems are not easy.

## Building

The `.ahk` is right there. Just let AutoHotkey run it and you're good. Compile it to an EXE if you want.

## Requirements

* AHK

To be honest, I don't know what version is necessary, but you probably won't need to update.
