# Prime Checker

A simple MIPS assembly program that checks if the inputted number is prime or not.

## Why?

I kinda wanted to put an assembly program in this repository but I didn't know what to make, so I made this.

Making games is pretty hard in MIPS (or any assembly language), so I didn't make a game. A console-based game in MIPS assembly is probably impossible to do correctly because you can't clear the console.

## Building

This repository assumes you know how to build each project you're interested in. MIPS assembly is a bit funky, so here's basic instructions:

* get a MIPS assembler (such as [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/) or [Spim](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/))
* build
