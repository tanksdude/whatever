# Quick Mult

Literally just a spreadsheet with a quick way of making a multiplication table.

## Why?

I was bored and gave myself a math challenge to try and make a multiplication table using only one formula for each cell. Making a formula for each row/column before copying it over took too long.

## how to do it, if you don't want to download the file

Assumption: table starts at A1

1. make your rows and columns of numbers, just like your multiplication tables from elementary school
2. set the blank top left cell (A1) to `1`
3. set the first real cell (1×1 or B2) to `=A2*B1/A1`
4. use the fill handle\* to set the rows to that equation, then the columns (or vice versa)
5. fix the top left cell by deleting it and setting 1×1 to `1`

\* (the little square in the bottom right of a cell)

## Building

It's an Excel file. Just download it and load it into a spreadsheet program.
