# Abs(x) using bitshifts

My implementation of `abs(x)` without using conditionals. [More efficient solutions exist.](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerAbs)

## Why?

I was bored and wanted to try some bit manipulation.

## Building (Linux)

Using the Makefile:

```
cd <this project>
make
```

Then `./abs.out`.
