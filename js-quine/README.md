# A Quine in JS (and HTML)

Just a quine in the `script` tag of a HTML document, and also a quine in pure JavaScript.

## Why?

I wanted to make a quine in HTML, thinking it would be impossible because HTML isn't a real programming language. Then I remembered that the `script` tag exists... suffice to say, it was really easy.

I then wondered how a quine would look in pure JS. It wasn't very different.

## Building

Just load `quine.html` file into a browser.

Alternatively, load `extra.js` into a browser console for a pure JS quine.
